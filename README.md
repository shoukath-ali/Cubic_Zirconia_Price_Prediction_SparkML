Cubic Zirconia Price Prediction Using Regression

Dataset Information:
You will be working with a dataset containing various characteristics of cubic zirconia
diamonds, along with their prices. Your task is to explore, clean, and preprocess the dataset,
then build regression models to predict the price of the diamonds based on these
characteristics.
Variable Descriptions:
carat: Carat weight of the cubic zirconia.
cut: Quality of the cut. Categories: Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal (in increasing
order).
color: Diamond color grading. Categories from D (best) to J (worst).
clarity: Diamond clarity grade, indicating the absence of inclusions or blemishes. Categories
from FL (Flawless) to I3 (most inclusions).
depth: The height of the diamond from the culet to the table, expressed as a percentage of its
average diameter.
table: The width of the diamondâ€™s table (flat top surface), expressed as a percentage of its
average diameter.
x: Length of the diamond in millimeters.
y: Width of the diamond in millimeters.
z: Height of the diamond in millimeters.
price: The price of cubic zirconia in US dollars.
